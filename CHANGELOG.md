# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-primer are documented here.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added
- **`--migrate`** — convert `.claude-setup.rc` (INI) to `.claude-primer.toml` (TOML); preserves project metadata (stacks, frameworks, deploy) in `[project]` section
- **`--init`** — interactively create `.claude-primer.toml` config file; `--yes` mode writes sensible defaults
- **`--update`** — self-update compiled binaries from GitHub releases with SHA256 verification; falls back to package manager advice for source installs
- **VS Code extension** — 5 commands (Generate, Dry Run, Show Diff, Init Config, Plan JSON); auto-resolves binary via PATH/npx/pipx
- **CI linting** — ruff (Python) and eslint (npm) checks on push/PR; pytest-cov with coverage artifact upload
- **Documentation** — new Commands and VS Code Extension guide pages

### Changed
- Author names updated to full legal names across all manifests and licenses

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added
- **`--diff` mode** — show unified diff of what would change without writing files; compare generated content against existing files
- **`.claude-primer.toml` config file** — persist CLI flag defaults in a `[flags]` section; CLI flags always override TOML values
- **npm test parity** — 138 npm tests (up from 110), covering confidence scoring, templates, watch mode, multi-agent output, plugins, telemetry, diff, and TOML config

### Fixed
- Release CI now skips npm/PyPI publish when version already exists (no more false 403 failures on re-runs)

## [1.5.1] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- `--watch-auto` no longer loops infinitely on its own generated files (re-snapshots mtimes after `run()`)
- Watch mode now passes `--agent`, `--format`, and `--plugin-dir` through to auto-regeneration
- Telemetry payload now includes real project metadata (stacks, frameworks, tier) instead of empty values
- E2E idempotency test checks for SKIP output instead of hash comparison (CLAUDE.md is self-referential)

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Plugin system** — `.claude-primer/plugins/` directory for custom generators; plugins receive full scan info and return `{filename, content}`; supports multi-file output; `--plugin-dir` flag for custom locations
- **Opt-in telemetry** — anonymous usage stats when `CLAUDE_PRIMER_TELEMETRY=1`; collects flags, stacks, timing only (no PII); `--telemetry-off` override; best-effort non-blocking POST
- **End-to-end integration tests** — CI job downloads built binaries and runs 6 scenarios: basic generation, --force idempotency, --plan-json shape, --agent codex, --dry-run, plugin system
- **Documentation site** — GitHub Pages at limaronaldo.github.io/claude-primer with guides for getting started, templates, watch mode, multi-agent, plugins, and CLI reference
- Full feature parity between Python and npm CLIs for plugins and telemetry

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Confidence-aware extraction** — `ScoredValue` dataclass tracks `(value, source, confidence)` for every extracted field; `--plan-json` now includes `confidence_scores`
- **Template system** — `.claude-primer/templates/` directory for section-level overrides with `{{variable}}` substitution; templates survive `--force` runs
- **Watch mode** — `--watch` flag monitors source files and regenerates docs on change; configurable with `--watch-interval` and `--watch-auto`
- **Multi-agent context output** — `--agent` flag generates context files for Cursor (`.cursor/rules/project.mdc`), Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), Windsurf (`.windsurfrules`), Aider (`.aider/conventions.md`), and Codex (`AGENTS.md`); supports `--agent all`
- Full feature parity between Python and npm CLIs for all new capabilities

### Fixed
- Intel macOS binary now builds on `macos-15-intel` runner (replaced deprecated `macos-13`)
- Stale `v1.2` version strings replaced with `__version__` constant across Python and npm
- `--force` no longer skips files when only template overrides changed (diff check moved after template merge)
- npm `--plan-json` now includes `confidence_scores` matching Python output

## [1.3.4] — 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Windows: PyInstaller binary failed with `UnicodeEncodeError` on cp1252 consoles (box-drawing chars)
- Windows: PyInstaller binary failed with `Failed to load Python DLL` due to `strip=True` breaking DLLs
- Docker: multi-arch build failed because PyInstaller can't cross-compile; switched to python:3.12-slim
- macOS: dropped deprecated macos-13 (Intel) runner from CI matrix

### Changed
- Release workflow smoke test uses `$RUNNER_TEMP` instead of `/tmp` for Windows compatibility
- Release workflow sets `PYTHONUTF8=1` for Windows smoke tests

## [1.3.2] — 2026-03-07

- npm package was missing README.md and LICENSE (not included in `files` whitelist)

### Added
- Platform distribution infrastructure:
  - PyInstaller spec for standalone binary builds
  - GitHub Actions release workflow (5-platform binary matrix + checksums + auto-publish)

  - Multi-stage Dockerfile for container distribution
  - Scoop bucket (`limaronaldo/scoop-bucket`) for Windows package management
  - winget manifest (prepared, pending first binary release)
  - Release template with download table and checklist
